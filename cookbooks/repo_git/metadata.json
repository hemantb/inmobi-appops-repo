See \"repo\" cookbook readme for details.\n\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n* <tt>rightscale</tt>\n* <tt>repo</tt>\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n== SETUP/USAGE:\n\n* Provider will be automatically initialized when you add \"repo:default\" recipe to your ServerTemplate runlist\n\n* Once setup, use the recipes in the 'repo' cookbook to install and manage your code repo.\n  See the repo/README.rdoc for usage details.\n\n* Select 'repo_git' option in repo/default/provider input.\n\n* To perform correct operations  repo/url, and repo/branch inputs must be filled.\n\n* To access to private git repositories repo/ssh_key input must contain string with private ssh key or 'key'-type variable from RightScale dashboard.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\n\nThe 'repo_git' implementation can be called with help of Lightweight Resource, which can be\nfound in the <tt>repo</tt> cookbook.\n\nFor more about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please see the Rigtscale\nGuide at:  http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)\n\n=== Attributes:\nnone\n\n=== Templates:\nnone\n\n=== Definitions:\nnone\n=== Libraries-helpers:\n\n<b>RightScale::Repo::Ssh_key.create(ssh_key)</b>\n\nCreate bash script, which will set user defined ssh key required to access to private git source code repositories.\n\nParameters\n\n<tt>ssh_key(String)::</tt> Git private ssh key\n\nRaise\n\n<tt>RuntimeError::</tt> if ssh key string is empty\n\n<b>RightScale::Repo::Ssh_key.delete</b>\n\nRemove bash script created by <tt>create</tt> method, after successful pull operation.\n\nParameters\n\nnone\n\n=== LWRPs:\n\n<tt>repo_git</tt> provider is defined in providers/default.rb file, it contains source for <tt>:pull</tt> and <tt>:capistrano_pull</tt> actions.\nFor more info about these actions please see <tt>repo</tt> cookbook readme.\n\n<tt>repo_git</tt> provider allows to get source code from GIT remote repositories.
