  "long_description": "= RightScale Loggind\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nThis cookbook provides a set of recipes used by the RightScale\nServerTemplates to configure the logging service provider.\n\nThis cookbook configures the default logging provider installed on the image.\nIf a remote server is defined it will configure sending log messages to the\nremote server.  If not the the default configuration is used (local files)\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Must be use with a 'logging' provide in the cookbook path\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n== COOKBOOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n* Currently only supports the logging provider installed on the image. (rsyslog/syslog-ng)\n* Currently only supports client configuration for a single remote server using\n  UDP without encryption or authentication.\n* Requires customer maintained remote server for remote logging.\n\n== SETUP:\n\n* Place logging::default recipe into your runlist to setup the logging resource. When\n  using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically configure\n  logging service provider (rsyslog/syslog-ng)\n\n* The default recipe will determine the logging provider installed (rsyslog/syslog-ng)\n  and configure it for remote logging.\n\n== USAGE:\n\n1. Local logging only.  Set the input logging/remote_server to ignore.  The default\n   configuration installed will be used.\n\n2. Remote logging.  Set the input logging/remote_server to the FQDN or IP of your\n   logging server.  The default configuration will be used with the remote logging\n   configuration appeneded.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\n\nThe 'logging' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found in\nthe resources/default.rb file.\n\nThis cookbook is intended as a framework for logging providers.  In its current\nimplementation it supports the minimum configuration for rsyslog and syslog-ng.\n\nThis cookbook does not modify the installed logging provider.\n\n=== Providers:\n\nThe current implementation does not support providers other than rsyslog and syslog-ng\n\n=== Custom Configuration\n\nBy using a override cookbook the default configuration can be customized by replacing\nthe providers default configuration file template.\n\n= LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
