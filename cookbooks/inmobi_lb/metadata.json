  "long_description": "= RightScale Load Balancer Cookbook \n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nThis cookbook provides a set of load balancer recipes used by the RightScale\nLoad Balancer ServerTemplates.\n\nThis cookbook does not contain a specific load balancer implementation; rather,\nit provides an interface for general load balancer actions and parameters.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\nThe 'lb' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found in\nthe resources/default.rb file.\n\nThis cookbook is intended to be used in conjunction with cookbooks that contain\nLightweight Providers that implement the 'lb' interface. See the RightScale\nlb_haproxy cookbook for an example.\n\nTo review information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), see the Chef\nWiki at:\n\n  http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Lightweight+Resources+and+Providers+%28LWRP%29\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n * Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n== SETUP:\n\n== USAGE:\n\n=== Application Server Attach\n\n==== do_attach_request\n\nThis recipe is used by application servers to request that load balancer servers\nconfigure themselves to attach to the application server.\n\n==== handle_attach recipes\n\nThis recipe is used by a load balancer server to add an application server to\nits configuration when the application server requests it, and restart if necessary.\n\n=== Application Server Detach\n\n==== do_detach_request\n\nThis recipe is used by application servers to request that load balancer servers\nconfigure themselves to detach from the application server.\n\n==== handle_detach recipes\n\nThis recipe is used by a load balancer server to remove an application server\nfrom its configuration when the application server requests it, and restart if necessary.\n\n=== Automatic Server Detection\n\n==== do_attach_all recipe\n\nThis recipe is used by the load balancer to automatically detect whether application\nservers have disappeared or reappeared, without detaching or reattaching using the\nother recipes. This recipe is set to run in a periodic reconverge, which, by default, runs every 15 minutes.\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n= LICENSE\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc. All rights reserved.
